I just want to start off by saying I could have taken the easier road and given answers like this:

Q1:
public static int question1(int[] arg0) {
        Arrays.sort(arg0);
        return arg0[arg0.length - 2];
    }
    
Q2:
    public static boolean question2(String arg1, String arg2) {
        return Integer.parseInt(arg1) > Integer.parseInt(arg2);
    }
    
   However, I took a little time to give you a better code. I have been a little short on time as of late, and I don't make many multidimensional arrays, so I did use outside resources to complete these tasks. I used geeksforgeeks, stackoverflow, guru99, W3School, and youtube as a reference for Questions 3,4 and 5. These are the answers I came up with. If given more time I would change a few things like implementing a Try{}Catch{} to actually handle the exceptions. I have also included a main method with some senarios, so you can test my code. Lastly, I really enjoyed this challeange it pushed me to do things I normally do not do at work and I enjoyed that a lot! If you have any questions or suggestions on my code feel free to reach me via Abbey at Apex, exclamationpointforfun@gmail.com, or 719-493-2674.
   
Thank you for your time and concideration,
Edward R. Rojas
